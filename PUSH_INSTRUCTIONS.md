# Push to GitHub Instructions

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Create a new repository named: recipes-project
3. Make it public or private (your choice)
4. DO NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. After creating, run these commands:

```bash
cd /Users/angus/Desktop/ghrepo/recipes-project
git remote add origin https://github.com/angusyang91/recipes-project.git
git push -u origin main
```

That's it! Your recipes project will be in its own repository.
